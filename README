WARNING: The plugin is still under heavy development and becomes ready to be used
for daily usage, but don't except a stable plugin yet.

Compiling instructions:
	1. Create a build directory in the source (mkdir build)
	2. Change to the new build directory (cd build)
	3. Execute: cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=USR_PREFIX (USR_PREFIX is usually /usr on most distros)
	4. Compile it: make
	5. Install it: make install (as root)

Testing/installing the plugin in a custom directory:
	1. Follow the steps above and choose a preferred CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
	2. Start Kopete using the custom services directory compiled in the preferred prefix:

	export KDEDIRS=/usr:CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (/usr is needed to keep the system-wide installed services usable, it can be different based on the distro)
